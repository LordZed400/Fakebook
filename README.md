# Fakebook

Fakebook is my first Web Application Project.  
Made using core PHP and HTML, it has a Login System where the Login information is stored in a MYSQL Database.  
The Database also contains other user information such as Address, Phone Number, Profile Picture, etc.  
  
The users have also been given privilages, because of which the Admins can perform additional functions such as Editing or Deleting information from the Database.  
There is also a Sign Up page to create an Account.  
This Project was made keeping the MVC architecture pattern in mind.  
  
This Web Application uses **PHP** and **HTML as the base, **CSS** and a few **JQuery** elements for stylizing and **SQL** for databse related operations.
